#This assignment is designed to have two numbers input; once input have a program that multiples and divides them
print('Welcome to Multiplication and Division Made Easy')
# I put this in here becasue if you divide by 0 it will error out and attempting to help people
print('Your second number cannot be zero; since division by zero is not possible')
#Each number is input here as intigers
num_1 = float((input("First Number: ")))
num_2 = float((input('Second Number: ')))
# If statement so that the second number cannot equal 0, if it does they get the message at else. 
if num_2 != 0:
    print(num_1, '*', num_2, '=', (num_1 * num_2))
    print(num_1, '/',  num_2, '=', (num_1 / num_2))
#Message received if they input 0 as the second number.
else:
    print('Start again and please follow instructions, the second number cannot be a ZERO!')
